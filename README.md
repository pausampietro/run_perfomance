# RUN PERFORMANCE PROJECT - Pau Sampietro 
### Final Project at Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp

This project has two clear objectives:
1. Develop an e2e analysis that incorporates all the tools learned during the data analytics bootcamp (or almost).
2. Establish a methodology that allows predicting future career rhythms for a given athlete.

#### Abstract: 
We obtain the data from suunto movescount app, and then we start working with moves from 2 different users, in order to compare the performance of both runners and also, try to make some predictions about future scheduled races. Using programming skills, some statitiscs and machine learning algorithms, we will try to get insights about important features, evolution along the time and forecasting, predictions based on recent moves, etc.
 
#### Technologies: 

* Python libraries such numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
* Machine learning libraries: sklearn, keras, tensorflow
* MySQL and relational databases.
* Conda enviroments and jupyter notebooks 
* Git version control

#### Statistical tools used:

* Descriptive statitiscs
* Inferential statitiscs
* Hypothesis tests, confidence intervals
* Goodness of fit tests

#### Visualization tools used:

* Histogram, pair/scatter/line/bar plots
