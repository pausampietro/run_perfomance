# RUN PERFORMANCE PROJECT - Pau Sampietro 
### Final Project at Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp

This project has two clear objectives:
1. Develop an e2e analysis that incorporates all the tools learned during the data analytics bootcamp (or almost).
2. Establish a methodology that allows predicting future career rhythms for a given athlete.
